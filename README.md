# Credit-Rewards-Management-Sys
A credit card company is launching a credit rewards campaign to celebrate its 5 year anniversary. 
The company would like to reward its existing customers who possess any one of their three credit card types. 
The rewards will allow its customers the ability to earn and redeem points and also obtain cash-back on purchases 
in its anniversary month subject to some conditions. At the end of the anniversary month, customers will have the 
chance to redeem their points for hotel, travel and dining experiences. The company has sought your assistance to
develop an information system that can handle the management of the rewards.
